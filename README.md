# Python_assignment_3
This repository includes solutions to various Python exercises, each designed to enhance problem-solving skills and programming expertise. The first exercise reads an integer (1â€“12) from the user and outputs the corresponding month name. The second exercise calculates cinema ticket prices based on age, applying discounts for children under 16 and seniors over 60. The third exercise computes BMI using weight and height inputs, categorizes the result into weight statuses, and displays the corresponding range. The fourth exercise identifies the greatest number among three user inputs. The fifth exercise calculates the factorial of a number using loops, while the sixth reverses a given number using a while loop. The seventh exercise finds and prints multiples of a number within a specified range. The eighth exercise creates an interactive loop to repeatedly print user input until the keyword "done" is entered, at which point the loop terminates. The ninth exercise implements the "FizzBuzz" challenge, printing numbers from 1 to 10 while substituting multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz." The final exercise generates a pattern of numbers in descending order, starting from 5 and reducing the range with each line. These exercises provide a practical and enjoyable way to practice Python and explore its versatility.
